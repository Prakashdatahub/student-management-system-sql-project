# 🎓 Student Management System (SQL Server)

A **fully functional Student Management System** designed using **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)** that demonstrates real-world database design, business logic automation, and data integrity handling.

This project showcases how a relational database can be used to manage students, courses, enrollments, and performance data efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Student Management System (SMS)** is built to handle academic data such as:
- Student records
- Course details
- Enrollments
- Marks & performance tracking

It focuses on **clean schema design**, **normalized tables**, and **SQL business logic**, making it suitable for **educational institutions** and as a **portfolio project for SQL/Data roles**.

## 🗂️ Database Schema

### 📌 Tables

| Table Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `Students` | Stores student personal and academic details |
| `Courses` | Contains course information |
| `Enrollments` | Maps students to courses |
| `Marks` | Stores marks obtained by students |

All tables follow **relational integrity** using **Primary Keys and Foreign Keys**.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

✔️ Structured & normalized database design  
✔️ Data integrity using **constraints**  
✔️ Business logic automation using **stored procedures**  
✔️ Real-time validation using **triggers**  
✔️ Scalable schema suitable for analytics & reporting

## ⚙️ SQL Concepts Implemented

### 🧱 Data Definition Language (DDL)
- `CREATE TABLE`
- `PRIMARY KEY`
- `FOREIGN KEY`
- `CHECK` constraints

### ✏️ Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`
- `SELECT`

### 🔄 Stored Procedures
- Insert and manage student records
- Automate enrollment operations
- Reusable business logic

### ⚡ Triggers
- Enforce data validation
- Maintain consistency during insert/update operations

### 🔗 Relationships
- One-to-Many relationships between:
  - Students → Enrollments
  - Courses → Enrollments

## 📊 Sample Use Cases

- Track student academic performance
- Manage course enrollments
- Generate reports using joins and aggregations
- Serve as a backend database for web or desktop applications

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
2. Create a new database (e.g., `StudentManagementDB`)
3. Open the `.sql` file
4. Execute the script step-by-step or all at once
5. Verify tables, procedures, and triggers

---

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
